I want to clarify since you went directly from competitive advantages for Tesla to comparing disadvantages for other people. I don't really see many disadvantages to Tesla themselves in this move.",1
1533808305,"&gt; What about buying more shares at those events? 

I believe with SpaceX shareholders (such as employees who earned equity) are selling back to SpaceX at the fixed price the valuation determined.

With Tesla they might use a more sophisticated scheme - we'll see the details once they announce it.

&gt; Are there any dividends or distributions of profits to shareholders? 

My guess is that by the time Tesla generates so much excess cash that they'd have to pay a dividend they might IPO to a public stock exchange again. Tesla becoming a trillion dollar company might be that point: that would be about $5,900/share.",1
1533808274,"&gt;  Assuming the deal goes through

It is interesting to speculate on this, I think it if comes to a vote it will almost certainly pass, even though some existing shareholders are squeezed out.

On the finances themselves board approval and regulatory approval, it is 50/50. I strongly suspect the money is from overseas and US regulators will sink the deal. If that happens we don't get to a vote.

Note: This is all just speculation, backed by zero evidence. :)",1

1533810733,"From all the research I’ve done reading forums. It appears that the changing of your delivery window is an automatic thing every time you update your order outside of the month you placed your original configuration in. 

So if you ordered in July it’ll say Sept-Oct but if you make a change in August it’ll automatically change you to Nov-Dec. 

But people don’t feel like that is a real change. It’s just a website glitch. Rest assured they still have your original order date and your car should arrive within the Sept-Nov time. ",1

&gt;Yeah, here you are demonstrating that you don't know how shorting works and what effects it has on a stock: 

Read maybe two sentences further and you will see that I clearly acknowledged that short interest can be higher than 100%. Here, I'll copy and paste it for you so that you don't even have to scroll up:

1533815218,Don't they need like 51% to control the vote? I think Musk has 20% so they need like another 31% of mixed buyouts and shareholders who agree with him.,1
1533815198,"Legally he would be required to show that they actually have reliable 100% funding to do so before making any announcement.

It's not about ""I was thinking of doing it"", it's about it being a 100% intent, planned and likely.  Otherwise you can say things like that whenever you want to manipulate the share price.",1
1533815186,"Because the deal is not finalized, and Elon never said it was. 

The only requirement from Musk vis-a-vis public disclosure is that he is truthful, i.e. has a reasonable basis to believe what he says is true. 

Things change during final negotiations. It is to be expected. For example, one of the major shareholders may come up with a new demand (say they want to increase their position by 50%).

So if Elon has a handshake with a strategic investor at 420, and has discussed this with enough of the current shareholders, that's good enough to win every lawsuit.

1533815154,"The buyout won't happen for, say, twelve months. You want money now. Why would I give you $420 for a commodity which will be worth exactly the same in twelve months rather than something which will be more likely to increase in value?",1

1533816120,"&gt; What are everyone's thoughts on when Tesla may go private?

My guess is this will happen once the Tesla board and the top 10 institutional holders agree on a buyout proposal. Here's the voting math:

- 25.31% of Tesla Shares is Held by All Insider
- 39.60% of Tesla Shares is held by Top Ten Institutional Holders
- 64.91% Total

If the board, all insiders and the top 10 institutional investors communicate their agreement publicly, then majority shareholder approval is a 99.999% done deal and the price will almost immediately jump very close to $420.

At that point:

- everyone who doesn't want to be part of the deal (or cannot hold private shares) will have an incentive to sell at prices above $420
- everyone who wants to become part of the Tesla story will be willing to pay a premium to get ownership.

This will reliably drive the price above $420 and will exchange every unwilling shareholder for a willing shareholder.

I.e. in the end, if there's enough people on the whole planet who want to be part of the Tesla story for 5-10 glorious years, the deal could easily cost less than 10 billion dollars.

They could also arbitrarily delay the shareholder vote to allow more people to jump on board, which would reduce the buyout price.

Whoever came up with this scheme is a financial genius.

Oh, and the TSLA shorts are *truly* screwed.
",1
1533816119,"Time-wise, this seems like the most realistic. The only problem is that if Q3 earnings numbers are **too** good, then $420 will seem even more undervalued after Q3 earnings release.

Even if the numbers aren't **that** good -- showing any sort of profitability in Q3 and credibility for higher profits in Q4 may still make $420 seem a bit on the lower side, particularly than it is now when there's still a bit of shroud of uncertainty over what Q3 and Q4 will bring.",1
1533816171,No the SEC would *never allow this*.  The only reason they raised the cap from 500 to 2000 external shareholders was due to the FB explosion - and even that rule change is still hugely controversial.  If you want to have external shareholders you must be in the public market.,1

If the most that is guaranteed from buying into TSLA right now is 420, then buying TSLA at 420 now is relatively worse than buying, say, an index fund that covers the S&amp;P500, since that's almost certainly going to increase over time, whereas TSLA at 420 has already reached its ceiling. So people don't buy it at 420, or 419, or *etc* until we get to where it's currently sitting at 369.",1
